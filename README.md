# C-Projects

Some first encounters with C

Code from Allocator, Fat16 Reader and Crone should works pretty well, Game code you launch at your own responsibility  

Allocator is just a my (very simple and truncated) implementation of malloc and calloc in C

Crown - schedile and run sh script by using C

FAT16 Reader - allow to read raw FAT16 bin file, CMD input offer functions like "dir, cat, cd, pwd" and some more (some day i swear i will correct all that stupid comparison of string and create boot sector structure to store data)

Game - Please don't even look at it, maybe some code about semaphores and mutex locks might be useful but everything else is pure garbage
